# Websocket Router

Allows browsers to connect to a server via a websocket and subscribe to a topic. Anyone can publish to a topic with a HTTP POST.

I wrote this to replace the deprecated Channel API in App Engine for my toy project.

### Demo

	python3 ./websocket_router.py
	
Then open websocket_demo.html in a browser locally.

### Configuration

    python3 ./websocket_router.py --help
